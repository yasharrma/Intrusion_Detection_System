# Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using NSL-KDD  

## Introduction  
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in cybersecurity by detecting unauthorized access and malicious activities within a network. This project explores the **NSL-KDD dataset**, a widely used benchmark for IDS research, and applies machine learning techniques to improve intrusion detection accuracy.  

## Why NSL-KDD?  
The **NSL-KDD dataset** is an improved version of the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. It addresses key issues such as redundant records and data imbalance, making it a more reliable benchmark for evaluating IDS models.  

## Project Overview  
This project follows a structured approach to analyze and build an effective IDS:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for better model performance.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding network traffic patterns through visualizations.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and refining features to enhance model effectiveness.  
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Training and evaluating various classifiers.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing models to determine the most effective IDS approach.
